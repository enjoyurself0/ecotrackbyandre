I am making an app called ecotrack hosted locally on my computer and the computers of those who have the folder. Here is what I want

Start by creating a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive, mobile-friendly interface that can display interactive charts, dashboards, and forms. The frontend should include a homepage with a visually appealing header, dynamic animations such as a floating green leaf over the title, and a navigation bar linking to all major pages, including Dashboard, Track Usage, Leaderboard, and Community sections. Implement a login and registration system with role-based access for students and administrators, using secure authentication and password hashing. For the backend, use Python with Flask to handle API requests, user management, and data storage, connecting to an SQLite database that stores user accounts, environmental usage records, and community survey data. Ensure input validation to prevent negative numbers or invalid entries and maintain internal documentation with comments and clear naming conventions. Integrate data visualization features using Chart.js or Google Charts to display trends in water and energy usage, leaderboard rankings, and survey results, embedding at least four charts in relevant sections. Incorporate AI functionality via scikit-learnâ€™s linear regression to predict next-week resource usage based on historical data and display it on the dashboard. Ensure the system complies with Australian Privacy Principles, including encryption of sensitive data, secure HTTPS connections, and ethical handling of student data without using biometric identifiers. Add a community feedback section by embedding a Google Form and associated visualizations, allowing students and teachers to interact and provide suggestions. Style the application with a cohesive green theme, using bold headings and animations for a professional and engaging look, and ensure the UI is intuitive, visually clean, and consistent across all pages. Include internal evaluation features to track student engagement, goal achievement, and overall effectiveness, with screenshots and testing logs ready for reporting. Throughout the project, follow the rubric closely, covering problem analysis, data collection, design documentation, software development, innovation, network security, visualization, evaluation, and project management to ensure a fully functional, innovative, and secure sustainability tracking application.
